# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
## Project Overview

This project is a responsive React application built with Vite and styled using Tailwind CSS. The application demonstrates modern front-end development practices, including component-based architecture, state management with React hooks, API integration, and responsive design.

### Structure and Implementation

- **Project Setup:**  
  The project was initialized using Vite for fast development and build times. Tailwind CSS was configured for utility-first styling, and the folder structure was organized into `components`, `pages`, `hooks`, `contexts`, `api`, and `utils` for maintainability.

- **Component Architecture:**  
  Reusable UI components such as `Button`, `Card`, `Navbar`, and `Footer` were created in the [`src/components`](src/components) directory. A layout component wraps the main content with navigation and footer, ensuring consistency across pages.

- **State Management and Hooks:**  
  The `TaskManager` component manages tasks using the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks. A custom `useLocalStorage` hook persists tasks between sessions. Theme management (light/dark mode) is handled with React context and Tailwind's dark mode support.

- **API Integration:**  
  Data is fetched from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder) using the Fetch API or Axios. The application displays the data in a list or grid, with loading and error states, pagination, and a search feature for filtering results.

- **Styling and Responsiveness:**  
  Tailwind CSS utility classes are used throughout for layout, spacing, typography, and color. The design is fully responsive, adapting to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens. Custom animations and transitions enhance interactivity.

- **Development Workflow:**  
  The project supports hot module replacement for rapid feedback during development. Linting and formatting are set up for code quality. The application can be built and deployed easily using the provided scripts.

This approach ensures a scalable, maintainable, and user-friendly application that meets modern web development standards.
